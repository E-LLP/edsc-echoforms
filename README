#To compile assets for exporting you'll need to do the following:
#Download & install the installation package for node and npm from http://nodejs.org/ (it's one package for both npm and node.js)

cd ~/workspace/echo-forms-plugin/

#Then set up your npm repo list with the latest files:

npm install 
gem install sass
npm install sass
npm install grunt

#Since we are not running with RVM environment set up properly, you need to make sure there is a Ruby executable set up in your shell environment.  
which ruby 
#if the above finds a ruby executable, then you should be good to go.  Otherwise, you will need to find Ruby and add it to your path
export PATH=$PATH:<PATH_TO_RUBY> (if not already in your path)

#make sure ./node_modules/.bin and /usr/local/bin are in your path.

#to compile, run
grunt

#if you want grunt to watch for changes to the coffee script files and compile automagically, run:
grunt watch


Instructions for compiling wgxpath from source:
$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/
$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/closure-library/
$ svn checkout http://wicked-good-xpath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ wicked-good-xpath-read-only

cd wicked-good-xpath-read-only.
Remove the lines following lines from compile.sh:  
   --compiler_flags="--compilation_level=ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS" \
   --compiler_flags="--use_types_for_optimization" \

change the following line:

  --output_mode compiled \
  to 
  --output_mode script \

apply the patch for namespaces from your vendor directory

patch nameTest.js <WORKSPACE_HOME>/echo-forms-plugin/vendor/wgxpath/wgxpathNameTestNamespaceFixes.patch

then run ./compile.sh


To minify, just change the output mode to compiled and add the two removed lines back in and run compile.sh again.
